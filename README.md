# springtech-java-project-2

### Set Up
1. Create a new DB called [ sprringtech ] in postgres and connect to it. 

    a. \c springtech

### Option1

- [X] Persist at least **four models** eg: (`Book`, `Author`, `Genre`, `Publisher`) to a PostgreSQL database.
- [X] Use Spring Profiles for environment settings.
- [X] At least one API endpoint must perform full CRUD **create, read, update, and delete actions**.
- [X] Other API endpoints can perform CRUD based on the business use-case.    
- [X] Expose CRUD routes that were built using **REST conventions**.
- [X] **Handle exceptions** gracefully.
- [X] Send appropriate messages back to the client in the event that an exception occurs.
- [X] Must have `Controller` and  `Service` separate.
- Document each end-point, such that

| Request Type | URL| Reqtest Body | 
|--|--|--|
| GET | /api/categories/ | None |

- Stick with the **KISS** (keep it simple, stupid) and **DRY** (don't repeat yourself) principles.

This is a backend program that utilizes a RESTful API to handle, receive and request data from a database that stores user information and more. The program is designed for an admin client side and allows for users to be created. The user also has the permission to add, update, delete and create new categogorized resources.
